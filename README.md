# Owleats
MIS Project to simulate a website that allows you to place orders for food trucks around campus. I only have some
basically functionlity since it was for a prototype.

 In order to use the application, follow these steps

Unzip the OwlEats folder to htdocs
Run the SQL file in a database on Phpmyadmin
Edit the constants.inc.php file in owleats/resources to fit your database/user specifications
The username and password to use the application is user and password. Although you can click on any vendor, we only setup the application for Eddie's truck for the purposes of demonstration.

To sign in as a vendor, both the username and password is eddies.

Please let me know if you have any issues with installation, or if you have any questions about the functionality.
A lot of the code isn't organized that well, since I was scrambling to add features when the presentation date got closer, so let me know if you can't find anything specific and I'll answer whatever I can.
